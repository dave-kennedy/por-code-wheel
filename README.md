This is the code wheel for the classic CRPG [Pool of Radiance][1] from [SSI][2].
There are two versions:

1. [This one][3] uses high resolution images of the code wheel to recreate the
   experience of physically rotating it in your hands using just your mouse. It
   requires a modern browser with support for CSS3.
2. [This one][4] is an updated version of the one created by Andrew Schultz,
   which I found [here][5]. It should work just fine in older browsers.
